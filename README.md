Piano is Analytics Domain Specific Language(DSL) for functional programming in Java language. It is being developed with vision to support functional programming for distributed computing (i.e. coordinated multiple run times, clusters etc.) and ecosystem (i.e. CDN, cloud, edge computing etc.) as fundamental requirement of digital age. It also acts as bridge framework to bring the best of functional programming aspects to object oriented language with analogy that network is the computer. The salient features of draft version would be to achieve the following minimum objectives. 
1.	Ubiquitous plug & play DSL as language extension without the need of additional compile & run time requirements. 
2.	Easy to use language construct for analytic workbench not limited to in built collection framework. 
3.	To enable high degree of re usability and portability for developing custom data and domain functions as programming components for better enterprise adoption. 
4.	To enable higher order functions as function chain, aggregate functions, composite & compound functions for real world use cases. 
5.	To enable on demand reactive function execution as Function as a Service(FAAS) & Service as Automated Function(SAAF) 
6.	Easy to debug & unit test complex & chain of functions. 
7.	And much more.  

Draft version would be copy right of the author & no license of usage is being granted. Version 1.0 and above would be released under Apache 2.0 license after organization sponsorship.
